README for `build-git`
======================

This bash script builds, tests and installs the newest version of Git, 
fetched from the master branch in the Git repository. Git is installed 
under `/usr/local/varprg/`_version_ by default, and creates symlinks in 
`/usr/local/prg/`, `/usr/local/bin/` and `/usr/local/share/man/` to the 
installed version. This makes it easy to revert to another version for 
testing. These defaults can be changed by changing variables in the 
beginning of the script. Written with paranoia in mind and aborts on 
every little error.
